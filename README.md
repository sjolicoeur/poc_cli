# poc_cli
Proof of concept cli that allows a cli to be pluggable and have it's development scaled across many teams

## Goals

- allow extra commands to be programmed in any language
- allow formating of the output by leveraging libxo
- human output should also be animated (wait spinners, clearing the screen of useless data...)
